    title: Hold my beer and watch this!
    details:
      - Perl has been described in many ways; a Shinto Shrine, executable line noise, a Swiss Army Chainsaw, the Duct Tape of the Internet, etc. But I think Perl is more like a old pop star, always reinventing itself to stay relevant, never truly leaving our consciousness, always just a melody away. What is the state of Perl today? Will Perl 6 be the big comeback? Will 2017 be the year we make Perl great again?

    speaker: Sawyer X
    title: Perl 5.24, 5.26, and the Future of Perl 5
    details:
      - "Perl 5 is doing well in its latest stable version: 5.24. It will soon see it's newest version: 5.26. So why is 5.24 exciting, why will 5.26 be even more exciting, and what can we expect of future versions of Perl 5?"
      - This is my talk given at FOSDEM, for those who could not attend and would like to know what the status and the future of Perl 5 is.
