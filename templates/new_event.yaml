    title: Perl as a first class citizen in Hadoop land
    details:
      - In Hadoop land (MapReduce, Hive, HBase) all non-jvm languages are second class citizens that mostly depend on the REST or thrift servers in order to get access to different functionality. But not all is available so it can be limiting at times.
      - Luckily, Perlito Java Backend opens up the possibility of accessing native hadoop/hive/hbase java APIs from Perl.
      - This talk will give some examples of that, like writing Hive UDF’s in Perl using Perlito Java Backend.
